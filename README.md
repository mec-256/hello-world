This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow
I am Eswar Chandra, currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering (3rd year). I have a strong interest in web development, with growing enthusiasm for cybersecurity and quantum computing. Recently, I have been exploring AI-assisted development and “vibe coding,” leveraging natural language and AI agents to rapidly prototype and build applications.

Beyond academics and technology, I enjoy watching and discussing anime and movies, as well as listening to music in my free time, which helps me stay creative and balanced.
